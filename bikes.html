<h3><b>In July 2018, I went to Whistler, B.C.</b></h3>
<p>We drove up to Whistler from Vancouver in a rental car. <br>Upon arrival, the first thing
  I noticed was a sea of mountain bikers. <br>I had no idea who these foreign people were. Riding a red cruiser<br> bike
  around Stanley Park in Vancouver was my first time riding <br>a bike in at least 2 years.
  I watched as the mountain bikers charged<br> down their dirt descents in full face helmets. My mom said<br> something
  along the lines of "that looks really dangerous." <br>Unbeknownst to me, I was at one of the world's premier bike<br> parks...
  and I <i>hiked</i> the whole time.  </p>

    <p>Within a week of returning to America, I got my first mountain <br>bike:
    a used 2013 Haro Flightline One. It retailed at $330 and<br> I got it for $115 on Craigslist.
    I learned basic skills on the Haro <br>and crashed a good bit, too.
    This bike served me well until <br>September 2018, when I took a trip to North Carolina's Dupont <br>State
    Forest. My brother, dad, and I rented a Santa Cruz <br>Chameleon
    from a Brevard bike shop and hit the trails. I rode<br> five miles on the Chameleon.
    Then I switched with my brother: <br>he rode the Chameleon for five miles while I rode his 2005 Giant <br>Boulder SE.
    The difference smacked me in the face.
    We rode<br> Ridgeline, the famous flow trail, two times. I used the Chameleon <br>the first time, and it was a blast.
    I used the Boulder the second time,<br> and I almost died. I felt every bump, in stark contrast to the <br>Chameleon
    and its Fox Rhythm 34 suspension fork. </p> <br>
    <p>On October 20th, 2018, after multiple months of searching<br> Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace, I got my "dream bike:"
    <br>the 2018 Kona Honzo AL/DR. </p>
